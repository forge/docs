== Using Forge

Forge is a code generator engine and it can be used through multiple UIs such as:

- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- JBoss Developer Studio (JBDS)

In this section you will be getting used to Forge by doing small tasks, either with CLI, JBDS, or both. JBoss Forge doesn't create any dependency on your code, it just generates it. So you can switch from CLI, to JBDS, to your own IDE without getting on Forge's way.

But let's get started.

=== Creating a new project

Setting up a new project involves a lot of activities. You basically rely on a build and dependency management framework such as Maven and Gradle. Even if you feel comfortable reading the configuration files, i.e. pom.xml or build.gradle for those, it takes some time to write them from scratch. What you usually do is consulting manuals or textbooks, look in internet or most often - copy and paste them from one of your recent projects. Some of you may decide to use archetypes or IDE wizards, but you will soon realize that these generate too much garbage in your project configurate, that you will usually delete.

==== CLI

To run Forge :
[code, console]
----
$ forge
----

The `project-new` is the one we need to quick start a project :

[code, console]
----
$ project-new --named cdbookstore
----

This will create an empty Maven project structure and a `pom.xml` file. The default `groupId` is `org.cdbookstore`, `artifactId` is `cdbookstore` and version number `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`. Also, the default project created is a web application, that's why you can see a `packaging` of type `war` and `maven-war-plugin` defined. If you want to change any of these parameters, just press `TAB` after a command and you will get all the parameters :

[code, console]
----
$ project-new --named cdbookstore --topLevelPackage com.example.project --projectFolder /directory/path --finalName cdbookwebapp --version 1.0.0.Final
----
projetFolder doesn't exist, targetLocation ?
I recommend not to execute this command because the wrong package will be created (not org.cdbookstore)

==== JBDS

If you run Forge from JBDS, open the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) then select Project: New and specify _cdbookstore_ as project name, 
_com.example_ as top level package, enter project location per your preference:

image::using/new-project.png[title="Creating new project"]

=== Setting up persistence and validation

Most of the Java EE applications need a relational database, map entities to it and do some sort of validation. Again, with JBoss Forge it is very easy to setup the persistence configuration, create an entity (or an embeddable), add fields to it and Bean Validation constraints. 

==== CLI

To create a new JPA entity, let's use the `jpa-new-entity` command : 

[code, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ jpa-new-entity --named Book
----

This command has several effects. First of all, it has created a `persistence.xml` file in the right place (under the `META-INF` directory) with all the default configuration for Hibernate. Then, it has created a `Book` entity under the subpackage `model`. Notice that this entity already has an `id` and `version` with its getters/setters. As you can see, the good thing with Forge is that with only one command all is setup and ready to go. 

If you do not wish to use the Java EE container default data-source, you can also specify additional connection parameters such as JNDI data-source names, JDBC connection information, and data-source types. Note, however, that this means you will probably need configure your application server to provide this new data-source and/or database connection.

[code, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ jpa-setup --provider Eclipse Link --dbType POSTGRES --dataSourceName java:comp/DefaultDataSource
----

Then, let's create a few fields. Again, one single command end Forge will do its best to simplify our lives :

[code, console]
----
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-field --named title
----

This creates an attribute called `title` of type `String` with get/set methods. Notice that Forge has also updated the `toString` method. Let's add more commands with different parameters (remember to press `TAB` to get the parameters) :


[code, console]
----
[persistence.xml]$ jpa-new-field --named title
[0] - com.example.project.model.book
Target Entity (The targetEntity which the field will be created): [0-0] 0
----
I have to write '0' here because I was in "persistence.xml" folder an not "Book.java" after executing "jpa-setup --provider Eclipse Link --dbType POSTGRES --dataSourceName java:comp/DefaultDataSource"
Maybe, add cd command to be in the correct folder "Book.java", or add precisions

[code, console]
----
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-field --named description --length 2000
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-field --named price --type java.lang.Float
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-field --named nbOfPages --type java.lang.Integer
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-field --named publicationDate --typeName java.util.Date --temporalType DATE
----
Does the parameter  "--temporalType DATE" really exist ?

As you can see, Forge has a all set of parameters to quickly create attributes and customize their JPA mapping. Now let's say we want to specify that a book is written in a certain language. We can use Forge to quickly create a Java enum and then have it as a JPA Enumerated in the `Book` entity :

[code, console]
----
[Book.java]$ java-new-enum --named Language --targetPackage org.cdbookstore.model
[Language.java]$ java-new-enum-const ENGLISH
[Language.java]$ java-new-enum-const FRENCH
----

This creates a Java enum, but notice the path on the left side : Forge CLI was set on the `Book` class (that's why you could read `[Book.java]$`). When we created the enum, the path changed to `[Language.java]$`. Like any other shell script, Forge has a certain number of commands to navigate between directories, classes or files (you will find the full list of commands in the Appendix). So, to go back to the `Book` entity we just use the `cd` command :

[code, console]
----
[Language.java]$ cd ..
[model]$ cd Book.java
[Book.java]$
----

Now that we are in the `Book` entity, we can create a new enum field with the following command : 

[code, console]
----
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-field --named language --type org.cdbookstore.model.Language
----

By default a JPA field is of type `String`. With the `--type` parameter we can choose from basic datatypes (`int`, `byte`, `char`â€¦), enum, or from other entities and choosing your cardinality (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, Many-to-Many). So let's create a new `Author` entity and have a Many-to-One relationship with `Book` :

[code, console]
----
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-entity --named Author
[Author.java]$ jpa-new-field --named firstName
[Author.java]$ cd ../Book.java
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-field --named author --type org.cdbookstore.model.Author --relationshipType Many-to-One
----

Forge takes care of all the JPA relational mapping between both entities. Now, on an entity, we can add Bean Validation constraints on properties with the `constraint-add` command.

[code, console]
----
[Book.java]$ constraint-add --constraint NotNull --onProperty title
[Book.java]$ constraint-add --constraint Past --onProperty publicationDate
[Book.java]$ constraint-add --onProperty description --constraint Size --max 3000
----

Behind the scenes Forge as created a `validation.xml` file, added the Bean Validation dependency and the needed constraints. BTW if you want to have a quick look at your code, you can use the `more` command or even `ls` your class :

[code, console]
----
[Book.java]$ ls

[fields]
author::org.cdbookstore.model.Author      language::org.cdbookstore.model.Language  publicationDate::java.lang.String
description::java.lang.String             nbOfPages::java.lang.Integer              title::java.lang.String
id::java.lang.Long                        price::java.lang.Float                    version::int

[methods]
equals(java.lang.Object)::boolean                  getPublicationDate()::java.lang.String             setLanguage(org.cdbookstore.model.Language)::void
getAuthor()::org.cdbookstore.model.Author          getTitle()::java.lang.String                       setNbOfPages(java.lang.Integer)::void
getDescription()::java.lang.String                 getVersion()::int                                  setPrice(java.lang.Float)::void
getId()::java.lang.Long                            hashCode()::int                                    setPublicationDate(java.lang.String)::void
getLanguage()::org.cdbookstore.model.Language      setAuthor(org.cdbookstore.model.Author)::void      setTitle(java.lang.String)::void
getNbOfPages()::java.lang.Integer                  setDescription(java.lang.String)::void             setVersion(int)::void
getPrice()::java.lang.Float                        setId(java.lang.Long)::void                        toString()::java.lang.String
----


==== JBDS

While from the JBDS, after opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac), 
you should choose _JPA: New Entity_ and you'll see a configuration window. 
This window come configured with Java EE container default data-source, but if you not do wish to use it, you can change your configuration as specified before with CLI.
In first step you need setup JPA in your project:

image::using/jpa-setup.png[title="Setup JPA"]

The next step you need configure your connection settings:

image::using/configure-connection-settings.png[title="Configuring Connection Settings"]

After the configuration step, you can create your first entity. +
Enter _Book_ as Entity name, _org.cdbookstore.model_ in Target package and click in finish.

image::using/jpa-new-entity.png[title="Creating a new Entity"]

Then you need add fields to your Entity. After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac), you should
choose _JPA: New Field_ and select the _Book_ as Target entity, _title_ as Field Name, _String_ as Type and click in 
finish:

image::using/new-field.png[title="Creating a new field in Entity"]

Repeat the step to create all field's Book class:
[source]
--
Field name: description | Length: 2000
Field name: price | Type: java.lang.Float
Field name: nbOfPages | Type: java.lang.Integer
Field name: publicationDate | Type java.util.Date | Temporal Type: DATE
--

Now you need to specify that a book is written in a certain language. 
We'll create a Java enum and then have it as a JPA Enumerated in the Book entity. After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac), you should
choose _Java: New Enum_ and enter _org.cdbookstore.model_ in Package name and _Language_ in Type Name:

image::using/new-enum.png[title="Creating a new Enum"]

Now you need add new constants to it. After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) you should choose _Java: New Enum Const_
and add all consts, this case:
[source]
--
ENGLISH
FRENCH
--

and click finish:

image::using/new-enum-const.png[title="Creating a new Enum Constant"]

Now, you need add this enum as field in book. After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) you should choose _JPA: New Field_ 
and select the _Book_ as Target Entity, enter _language_ as Field name and select _org.cdbookstore.model.Language_ as Field Type:

image:using/new-enum-jpa-field.png[title="Creating a new Enum field in Entity"]

Now you need create a new Entity (Same that you did with Book):
[source]
--
Entity Name: Author
--

and create a new field to it (Same that you did in Book):
[source]
--
Field Name: firstName | Type: String
--

Then you need to have a Many-to-One relationship with `Book`. 
After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) you should choose _JPA: New Field_ select the _Book_ as Target Entity
enter _language_ as Field name, select _org.cdbookstore.model.Language_ as Field Type and mark _Many-to-One_ as Relationship Type and click finish:

image::using/new-relationship.png[title="Creating a new relationship"]

You can configure your relationship in next step as well:

image::using/relationship-configuration.png[title="Configuring relationship"]

Forge takes care of all the JPA relational mapping between both entities. +
Now, on an entity, we can add Bean Validation constraints. After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) you should choose _Constrait: Add_,
you'll see a configuration window as in first step of the _JPA: New Entity_ that you did before:

image::using/configure-constraint.png[title="Configuring Constraint"]

You should choose the _Generic Java EE_ as Bean Validation provider and checked in Provided by Application Server?. 
If you don't want the default configuration provided by Application Server you can change your 
configurations as well. The next step you need choose _org.cdbookstore.model.Book_ as Class:

image::using/add-constraint.png[title="Adding Constraint"]

In next step you need specify what's _Property_ and what's _Constraint_. 
This case will need add NotNull on _title_ property:

image::using/add-notnull-constraint.png[title="Adding NotNull Constraint"]

You can define if you want on property or on property accessor.
The next step you can configure _payload_, _groups_ and _message_:

image:using/configure-constraint.png[title="Configuring Constraint"]

click in finish. You need add more two constraints:
[source]
--
Constraint: Past | Property: publicationDate
Constraint: Size | Max: 3000 |  Property: description
--


=== Scaffolding JSF

JSF is the default Java EE user interface framework, and so, JBoss Forge has a great support for it. In fact, Forge can scaffold an entire CRUD web application very easily. The JSF generated application follows several patterns and best practices : usage of CDI conversation, extended persistence context, JSF converters and so on. If you don't believe it, just try it. 

==== CLI

Now that we have created fields in the entities, itâ€™s time to scaffold web pages for these entities. We can either scaffold per entity, or use a wildcard to let Forge know it can generate a UI for each entity

[code, console]
----
[model]$ scaffold-generate --targets org.cdbookstore.model.*
----

This has the same effect of scaffolding per entity :

[code, console]
----
[model]$ scaffold-generate --targets org.cdbookstore.model.Book
[model]$ scaffold-generate --targets org.cdbookstore.model.Author
----

By default Forge scaffolds a web application with JSF 2.0 but you can change this configuration by executing the `faces-setup` command. In fact, most of the Forge commands can be setup (e.g. `jpa-setup`, `servlet-setup`...)

[code, console]
----
$ faces-setup --facesVersion 2.2
----

==== JBDS

In JBDS it's simple too. After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) you should choose _Scaffold: Generate_, choose _Faces_ as Scaffold Type:

image::using/faces-scaffold.png[title="Configuring Faces Scaffold"]

The next step you can see a configuration winzard:

image::using/faces-configuration-scaffold.png[title="Setup Facets"]

By default Forge scaffolds set this values, but you can change this configuration as well. +
In next step you can select that entity you want generate scaffold, this case we'll generate for all:

image:using/select-jpa-entities.png[title="Selecting JPA entities"]

click in finish and JBoss Forge will create all it needs.

=== Scaffolding RESTEndpoints

REST is a very popular technology nowadays. If you want to create REST endpoints on our entities, or if you want to add a REST endpoint on your existing Java EE web application, Forge is there to help. Forge can quickly scaffold REST endpoints for each entity, giving you a set of CRUD methods. And again, generating all the code plumbing and following best practices. 

==== CLI

Now that we have a few entities (`Book` and `Author`), itâ€™s time to generate REST endpoints. Like for JSF, it is just a matter of executing one single command :

[code, console]
----
[model]$ rest-generate-endpoints-from-entities --targets org.cdbookstore.model.*
----

This is the easiest command to generate the REST endpoints, but like most Forge commands, you can customize a few paramaters if you want, such as package name and so on.

While "holding" most files, you may inspect them using ls. This also works on REST endpoints. So, if you `cd` `BookEndpoint.java` and execute the command `ls`, this is what you get :

[code, console]
----
[model]$ cd ../rest/BookEndpoint.java
[BookEndpoint.java]$ ls

[fields]
em::javax.persistence.EntityManager

[methods]
create(org.cdbookstore.model.Book)::javax.ws.rs.core.Response  findById(java.lang.Long)::javax.ws.rs.core.Response            update(org.cdbookstore.model.Book)::javax.ws.rs.core.Response
deleteById(java.lang.Long)::javax.ws.rs.core.Response          listAll(java.lang.Integer,java.lang.Integer)::java.util.List
----

==== JBDS

After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) you should choose _REST: Generate Endpoints from Entities_, the first step, you need to configure the REST in your application, enter all information such as:

image::using/rest-setup.png[title="Configuring REST"]

The next step you'll have a list of the all entity that your application has, select all and click finish:

image::using/rest-entities.png[title="Generating RESTEndpoints from JPA entities"]

You can customize some values if you prefer, such as _Configuration Strategy_, _Class Name_, _Content Type_ and so on.


=== Deploying on WildFly

Do we need to introduce http://wildfly.org/[WildFly]? Quickly then. WildFly is a flexible, lightweight, managed application runtime that helps you build amazing applications... and we going to need it to deploy our web application and REST endpoints. For that, we have several options : http://wildfly.org/downloads/[download] it, install, execute and deploy our web application, or use a JBoss Forge addon. Let's try that.

==== Installing the JBoss AS Forge addon

The beauty of JBoss Forge is that it's extensible. In fact, Forge is a add-on container (called Furnace) and everything is seen as an extension (as a matter of fact, the CLI is an add-on!). To see the list of add-ons, juste visit the Forge documentation(http://forge.jboss.org/addons). And if you want to see all the already installed add-ons, execute the following command : 

[code, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ addon-list
Currently installed addons:
org.arquillian.forge:arquillian-addon,1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
org.jboss.forge.addon:addon-manager,2.12.2-SNAPSHOT
org.jboss.forge.addon:addon-manager-spi,2.12.2-SNAPSHOT
org.jboss.forge.addon:addons,2.12.2-SNAPSHOT
org.jboss.forge.addon:as,2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
org.jboss.forge.addon:as-jboss-as7,2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
org.jboss.forge.addon:as-jboss-wf8,2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
org.jboss.forge.addon:as-spi,2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
org.jboss.forge.addon:bean-validation,2.12.2-SNAPSHOT
org.jboss.forge.addon:configuration,2.12.2-SNAPSHOT
...
----

Enough, talking, let's install the http://forge.jboss.org/addon/org.jboss.forge.addon:as[WildFly add-on]. For that, in the Forge console just type the following command (and wait for Maven to download the Internet) :

[code, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ addon-install-from-git --url https://github.com/jerr/as-addon  --coordinate org.jboss.forge.addon:as,2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
[cdbookstore]$ addon-install-from-git --url https://github.com/jerr/jboss-as-addon  --coordinate org.jboss.forge.addon:jboss-as-wf8,2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
----

Now that you installed this new add-on, you get new `as-setup` command : 

[code, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ as-setup --server wildfly8
----

Wait a bit until WildFly is downloaded.... (in the meantime you can go to `~/.forge/addons` and have a look at what's happening... you can even check the logs under `~/.forge/addons`)... ok, now that JBoss is downloaded into your local Maven directory... there it is.... just enter `as`, press `TAB` and you will see new commands : 

[code, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ as-
as-deploy  as-setup  as-shutdown  as-start  as-undeploy
----

So let's build the application, start JBoss with `as-start` and deploy our application with `as-deploy` :

[code, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ build
[cdbookstore]$ as-start
(...)
JBoss logs
(...)
[cdbookstore]$ as-deploy
----

WildFly is started, the application is deployed, you can now go to http://localhost:8080/cdbookstore and create new books and authors. 

==== Installing the JBoss AS Forge addon on JBDS

After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) you should choose _Install an Addon from GIT_, enter
_https://github.com/jerr/as-addon_ as GIT Repository URL ad _org.jboss.forge.addon:as,2.0.0-SNAPSHOT_ as Coordinate:

image::using/addon-install.png[title="Installing an Addon"]

You need to do the same action for:
[source]
--
GIT Repository: https://github.com/jerr/jboss-as-addon | Coordinate: org.jboss.forge.addon:jboss-as-wf8,2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
--

Now, you can setup your server. After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) you should choose
_AS: Setup_, select wildfly8:

image::using/as-setup.png[title="AS Setup"]

The next step you can to configure the _Install directory_, _Port_ and so on:

image::using/as-configuration.png[title="Configuration AS"]

So let's build the application:

Select the option _Build_ in Forge Wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac):

image::using/build.png[title="Building"]

Now start server with option _AS: Start_ and deploy application with _AS: Deploy_:

image::using/as-deploy.png[title="Deployinig"]

Only click finish and your application will be deployed on WildFly.


=== Creating Arquillian tests

http://arquillian.org/[Arquillian] is an innovative and highly extensible testing platform for the JVM that enables developers to easily create automated integration, functional and acceptance tests for Java middleware. Picking up where unit tests leave off, Arquillian handles all the plumbing of container management, deployment and framework initialization so you can focus on the task at hand, writing your tests. Real tests. In shortâ€¦

Arquillian brings the test to the runtime so you donâ€™t have to manage the runtime from the test (or the build). Arquillian eliminates this burden by covering all aspects of test execution, which entails:

- Managing the lifecycle of the container (or containers)
- Bundling the test case, dependent classes and resources into a ShrinkWrap archive (or archives)
- Deploying the archive (or archives) to the container (or containers)
- Enriching the test case by providing dependency injection and other declarative services
- Executing the tests inside (or against) the container
- Capturing the results and returning them to the test runner for reporting

To avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into the developerâ€™s build environment, Arquillian integrates seamlessly with familiar testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit 4, TestNG 5), allowing tests to be launched using existing IDE, Ant and Maven test plugins â€” without any add-ons.
