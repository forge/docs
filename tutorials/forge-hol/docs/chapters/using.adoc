== Using Forge

Forge can be used as a code generation engine, and can be accessed through multiple user interfaces (UIs) such as:

- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- JBoss Developer Studio (JBDS)
- IntelliJ IDEA (not shown in this lab)

In this section you will be getting used to Forge by performing smaller tasks, either with CLI, JBDS, or both. It is worth noting that JBoss Forge doesn't create introduce any special or proprietary dependencies in your code, it just generates a functional starting point, and lets you continue as neede. This means you can switch from CLI, to JBDS, to your own IDE (unrelated to Forge) without getting in Forge's way, and without Forge getting in the way of your IDE. 

NOTE: In this section and the following sections, We will assume that you have already intstalled JBoss Forge.

Let's get started!

=== Creating a new project

Setting up a new project can involve quite a few activities. Typically, projects require a build and dependency management framework such as Maven, or Gradle. Even if you feel comfortable reading the respective configuration files, i.e. `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`, it can takes some time to create them from scratch. What you usually do is consulting manuals or textbooks, look in internet or most often - copy and paste them from one of your recent projects. Some of you may decide to use archetypes or IDE wizards, but you will soon realize that these generate too much garbage in your project configurate - garbage that you will usually delete.

==== CLI

The `project-new` command is what we will use to quick start a project :

[source, console]
----
$ project-new --named cdbookstore
----

This will create an empty Maven project structure and a `pom.xml` file. The default `groupId` is `org.cdbookstore`, `artifactId` is `cdbookstore` and version number `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`. Also, the default project created is a web application, that's why you can see a `packaging` of type `war` and `maven-war-plugin` defined. If you want to change any of these options, just press `TAB` after a command and you will get all the command options:

[source, console]
----
$ project-new --named cdbookstore --topLevelPackage com.example.project --targetLocation /directory/path --finalName cdbookwebapp --version 1.0.0.Final
----

==== JBDS

If you run Forge from JBDS, open the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) then select Project: New and specify _cdbookstore_ as project name, 
_com.example_ as top level package, enter project location per your preference:

image::../images/using/new-project.png[title="Creating new project"]

=== Setting up persistence and validation

Most of the Java EE applications need a relational database, map entities to it and do some sort of validation. Again, with JBoss Forge it is very easy to setup the persistence configuration, create an entity (or an embeddable), add fields to it and Bean Validation constraints. 

==== CLI

To set up JPA and create a new JPA entity, let's use the `jpa-new-entity` command : 

[source, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ jpa-new-entity --named Book
----

This command has several effects. First of all, it has created a `persistence.xml` file in the right place (under the `META-INF` directory) with all the default configuration for Hibernate. Then, it has created a `Book` entity under the subpackage `model`. Notice that this entity already has an `id` and `version` with its getters/setters. As you can see, the good thing with Forge is that with only one command all is setup and ready to go. 

If you do not wish to use the Java EE container default data-source, you can also specify additional connection options such as JNDI data-source names, JDBC connection information, and data-source types. Note, however, that this means you will probably need configure your application server to provide this new data-source and/or database connection.

[source, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ jpa-setup --provider Eclipse Link --dbType POSTGRES --dataSourceName java:comp/DefaultDataSource
----

If you have executed the `jpa-setup` command, you've noticed that the prompt has changed: you went from `[cdbookstore]` to `[persistence.xml]`. In Forge, the prompt always tells you where you are. You can even enter the command `pwd` or `ls`. For now, let's go back into the `Book` entity: enter `cd~~` brings you to the root directory, and then `cd src/main/java/org/cdbookstore/model/Book.java`. 

So, let's create a few fields in the `Book` entity. Again, one single command end Forge will do its best to simplify our lives :

[source, console]
----
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-field --named title
----

This creates an attribute called `title` of type `String` with get/set methods. Notice that Forge has also updated the `toString` method. Let's add more commands with different options (remember to press `TAB` to get the options) :

[source, console]
----
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-field --named description --length 2000
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-field --named price --type java.lang.Float
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-field --named nbOfPages --type java.lang.Integer
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-field --named publicationDate --type java.util.Date --temporalType DATE
----

As you can see, Forge has a set of options to quickly create attributes and customize their JPA mappings. Now let's say we want to specify that a book is written in a certain language. We can use Forge to quickly create a Java enum and then have it as a JPA Enumerated in the `Book` entity :

[source, console]
----
[Book.java]$ java-new-enum --named Language --targetPackage org.cdbookstore.model
[Language.java]$ java-new-enum-const ENGLISH
[Language.java]$ java-new-enum-const FRENCH
----

This creates a Java enum, but notice the path on the left side : Forge CLI was set on the `Book` class (that's why you could read `[Book.java]$`). When we created the enum, the path changed to `[Language.java]$`. Like any other shell script, Forge has a certain number of commands to navigate between directories, classes or files (you will find the full list of commands in the Appendix). So, to go back to the `Book` entity we just use the `cd` command :

[source, console]
----
[Language.java]$ cd ..
[model]$ cd Book.java
[Book.java]$
----

Now that we are in the `Book` entity, we can create a new enum field with the following command : 

[source, console]
----
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-field --named language --type org.cdbookstore.model.Language
----

By default, a JPA field is of type `String`. With the `--type` option we can choose from basic datatypes (`int`, `byte`, `char`â€¦), enum, or from other entities and entity cardinality (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, Many-to-Many). So let's create a new `Author` entity, and add a Many-to-One relationship with `Book` :

[source, console]
----
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-entity --named Author
[Author.java]$ jpa-new-field --named firstName
[Author.java]$ cd ../Book.java
[Book.java]$ jpa-new-field --named author --type org.cdbookstore.model.Author --relationshipType Many-to-One
----

Forge takes care of all the JPA relational mapping between both entities. Now, on an entity, we can add Bean Validation constraints on properties with the `constraint-add` command.

[source, console]
----
[Book.java]$ constraint-add --constraint NotNull --onProperty title
[Book.java]$ constraint-add --constraint Past --onProperty publicationDate
[Book.java]$ constraint-add --onProperty description --constraint Size --max 3000
----

Behind the scenes Forge as created a `validation.xml` file, added the Bean Validation dependency and the needed constraints. If you want to take a glance at the code, and see a summary of progress, you can use the `more` command or even `ls` your class :

[source, console]
----
[Book.java]$ ls

[fields]
author::org.cdbookstore.model.Author      language::org.cdbookstore.model.Language  publicationDate::java.lang.String
description::java.lang.String             nbOfPages::java.lang.Integer              title::java.lang.String
id::java.lang.Long                        price::java.lang.Float                    version::int

[methods]
equals(java.lang.Object)::boolean                  getPublicationDate()::java.lang.String             setLanguage(org.cdbookstore.model.Language)::void
getAuthor()::org.cdbookstore.model.Author          getTitle()::java.lang.String                       setNbOfPages(java.lang.Integer)::void
getDescription()::java.lang.String                 getVersion()::int                                  setPrice(java.lang.Float)::void
getId()::java.lang.Long                            hashCode()::int                                    setPublicationDate(java.lang.String)::void
getLanguage()::org.cdbookstore.model.Language      setAuthor(org.cdbookstore.model.Author)::void      setTitle(java.lang.String)::void
getNbOfPages()::java.lang.Integer                  setDescription(java.lang.String)::void             setVersion(int)::void
getPrice()::java.lang.Float                        setId(java.lang.Long)::void                        toString()::java.lang.String
----


==== JBoss Developer Studio (JBDS)

While working from JBoss Developer Studio (JBDS), after opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac), 
you should choose _JPA: New Entity_ and you'll see a JPA configuration window. This window provides default values for the Java EE container default data-source, but if you not do wish to use it, you can change your configuration as specified before with CLI. 

In first step you need setup JPA in your project:

image::../images/using/jpa-setup.png[title="Setup JPA"]

The next step you need configure your connection settings:

image::../images/using/configure-connection-settings.png[title="Configuring Connection Settings"]

After the configuration step, you can create your first entity. +
Enter _Book_ as Entity name, _org.cdbookstore.model_ in Target package and click Finish.

image::../images/using/jpa-new-entity.png[title="Creating a new Entity"]

Then you need add fields to your Entity. After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac), you should
choose _JPA: New Field_ and select the _Book_ as Target entity, _title_ as Field Name, _String_ as Type and click 
Finish:

image::../images/using/new-field.png[title="Creating a new field in Entity"]

Repeat the step to create all field's Book class:
[source]
--
Field name: description | Length: 2000
Field name: price | Type: java.lang.Float
Field name: nbOfPages | Type: java.lang.Integer
Field name: publicationDate | Type java.util.Date | Temporal Type: DATE
--

Now you need to specify that a book is written in a certain language. 
We'll create a Java enum and then have it as a JPA Enumerated in the Book entity. After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac), you should
choose _Java: New Enum_ and enter _org.cdbookstore.model_ in Package name and _Language_ in Type Name:

image::../images/using/new-enum.png[title="Creating a new Enum"]

Now you need add new constants to it. After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) you should choose _Java: New Enum Const_
and add all consts, this case:
[source]
--
ENGLISH
FRENCH
--

and click Finish:

image::../images/using/new-enum-const.png[title="Creating a new Enum Constant"]

Now, you need add this enum as field in book. After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) you should choose _JPA: New Field_ and select the _Book_ as Target Entity, enter _language_ as Field name and select _org.cdbookstore.model.Language_ as Field Type:

image::../images/using/new-enum-jpa-field.png[title="Creating a new Enum field in Entity"]

Now you need create a new Entity (Same that you did with Book):
[source]
--
Entity Name: Author
--

and create a new field to it (Same that you did in Book):
[source]
--
Field Name: firstName | Type: String
--

Now you need to add a Many-to-One relationship with `Book`. 

Open the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) and choose _JPA: New Field_, select the _Book_ as Target Entity. Enter _author_ as Field name, select _org.cdbookstore.model.Author_ as Field Type and mark _Many-to-One_ as Relationship Type and click Finish (or Next):

image::../images/using/new-relationship.png[title="Creating a new relationship"]

If you choose Next instead of Finish, You can configure your relationship:

image::../images/using/relationship-configuration.png[title="Configuring relationship"]

Forge takes care of all the JPA relational mapping between both entities. +

Now, on an entity, we can add Bean Validation constraints. Open the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) and choose _Constrait: Add_. You'll see a configuration window, just like first step of the _JPA: New Entity_ that you executed before:

image::../images/using/setup-constraint.png[title="Setup Bean Validation"]

You should choose the _Generic Java EE_ as Bean Validation provider and check "Provided by Application Server?". 
If you don't want the default configuration provided by Application Server you are free to change your 
configurations. Click Next, and choose _org.cdbookstore.model.Book_ as Class:

image::../images/using/add-constraint.png[title="Adding Constraint"]

In next step you need specify the property on which to operate _Property_ and the _Constraint_ to configure. 
In this case, let's add NotNull on _title_ property:

image::../images/using/add-notnull-constraint.png[title="Adding NotNull Constraint"]

Once the constraint is selected, you can also specify if you want the constraint to appear on the property itself, or on the property accessor (getter method).

Click Next to configure _payload_, _groups_ and _message_:

image::../images/using/configure-constraint.png[title="Configuring Constraint"]

Click Finish. 

Now add two more constraints to the Book class:
[source]
--
Constraint: Past | Property: publicationDate
Constraint: Size | Max: 3000 |  Property: description
--


=== Scaffolding JSF

JSF is the default Java EE user interface framework, and consequently JBoss Forge has a great support for it. In fact, Forge can scaffold an entire CRUD web application from JPA entities very easily, with only a single command. The JSF generated application follows several patterns and best practices: usage of CDI conversation scope, the extended persistence context, JSF converters and so on. If you don't believe it, just try it. 

==== CLI

Now that we have created fields in the entities, itâ€™s time to scaffold web pages for these entities. We can either scaffold per entity, or use a wildcard to let Forge know it can generate a UI for each entity

[source, console]
----
[model]$ scaffold-generate --targets org.cdbookstore.model.*
----

This has the same effect of scaffolding per entity :

[source, console]
----
[model]$ scaffold-generate --targets org.cdbookstore.model.Book
[model]$ scaffold-generate --targets org.cdbookstore.model.Author
----

In a single command Forge has generated configurations files (`web.xml`, `faces-config.xml`, ...), JSF pages for both `Book` and `Author`, images, CSS and added Bootstrap for the layout.

By default Forge scaffolds a web application with JSF 2.0 but you can change this configuration by executing the `faces-setup` command. In fact, most of the Forge commands can be setup (e.g. `jpa-setup`, `servlet-setup`...)

[source, console]
----
$ faces-setup --facesVersion 2.2
----

==== JBDS

In JBDS it's simple too. After opening the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) you should choose _Scaffold: Generate_, choose _Faces_ as Scaffold Type:

image::../images/using/faces-scaffold.png[title="Configuring Faces Scaffold"]

Click Next to configure the Faces Scaffold:

image::../images/using/faces-configuration-scaffold.png[title="Setup Facets"]

By default Forge scaffolds set suggested values for Java EE specification versions, but you can change this configuration as well.

Click Next to continue to select entities for which you want to generate scaffolding. In this case we'll generate for all entities:

image::../images/using/select-jpa-entities.png[title="Selecting JPA entities"]

Click Finish and JBoss Forge will create your user interface.

=== Scaffolding RESTEndpoints

REST is a very popular technology nowadays. If you want to create REST endpoints on our entities, or if you want to add a REST endpoint on your existing Java EE web application, Forge is there to help. Forge can quickly scaffold REST endpoints for each entity, giving you a set of CRUD methods. And again, generating all the code plumbing and following best practices. 

==== CLI

Now that we have a few entities (`Book` and `Author`), itâ€™s time to generate REST endpoints. Like for JSF, it is just a matter of executing one single command:

[source, console]
----
[model]$ rest-generate-endpoints-from-entities --targets org.cdbookstore.model.*
----

This is the easiest command to generate the REST endpoints, but like most Forge commands, you can customize a few options if you want, such as package name and so on.

While "holding" most files as the current resource, you may inspect them using ls. This also works on REST endpoints. So, if you `cd` `BookEndpoint.java` and execute the command `ls`, this is what you get :

[source, console]
----
[model]$ cd ../rest/BookEndpoint.java
[BookEndpoint.java]$ ls

[fields]
em::javax.persistence.EntityManager

[methods]
create(org.cdbookstore.model.Book)::javax.ws.rs.core.Response  findById(java.lang.Long)::javax.ws.rs.core.Response            update(org.cdbookstore.model.Book)::javax.ws.rs.core.Response
deleteById(java.lang.Long)::javax.ws.rs.core.Response          listAll(java.lang.Integer,java.lang.Integer)::java.util.List
----

==== JBDS

Open the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) and choose _REST: Generate Endpoints from Entities_, the first step, you need to configure the REST in your application, enter all information such as:

image::../images/using/rest-setup.png[title="Configuring REST"]

Click next to select the entities for which endpoints should be generated, select all, and click Finish (or click Next for more options):

image::../images/using/rest-entities.png[title="Generating RESTEndpoints from JPA entities"]

You can customize some options if you prefer, such as _Configuration Strategy_, _Class Name_, _Content Type_ and so on.


=== Deploying on WildFly

Does the WildFly application server need much of an introduction? http://wildfly.org/[WildFly]? Quickly then. WildFly is a flexible, lightweight, managed application runtime that helps you build amazing applications... and we are going to need it to deploy our web application and REST endpoints. For that, we have several options : http://wildfly.org/downloads/[download] it, install, execute and deploy our web application, or use a JBoss Forge addon. Let's try that.

==== Installing the JBoss AS Forge addon

The beauty of JBoss Forge is that it's extensible. In fact, Forge is a add-on container (called Furnace) and everything is seen as an extension (as a matter of fact, the CLI itself is an add-on!). To see the list of add-ons, visit the Forge documentation(http://forge.jboss.org/addons). And if you want to see all the already installed add-ons, execute the following command : 

[source, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ addon-list
Currently installed addons:
org.jboss.forge.addon:addon-manager,2.12.2-SNAPSHOT
org.jboss.forge.addon:addon-manager-spi,2.12.2-SNAPSHOT
org.jboss.forge.addon:addons,2.12.2-SNAPSHOT
org.jboss.forge.addon:bean-validation,2.12.2-SNAPSHOT
org.jboss.forge.addon:configuration,2.12.2-SNAPSHOT
...
etc
...
----

Enough, talking, let's install the http://forge.jboss.org/addon/org.jboss.forge.addon:as[WildFly add-on]. For that, in the Forge console just type the following commands (and wait for Maven to download the Internet) :

[source, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ addon-install-from-git --url https://github.com/jerr/as-addon  --coordinate org.jboss.forge.addon:as,2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
[cdbookstore]$ addon-install-from-git --url https://github.com/jerr/jboss-as-addon  --coordinate org.jboss.forge.addon:jboss-as-wf8,2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
----

Now that you installed these new add-on, you get new `as-setup` command : 

[source, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ as-setup --server wildfly8
----

Wait a bit until WildFly is downloaded.... (in the meantime you can go to `~/.forge/addons` and have a look at what's happening... you can even check the logs under `~/.forge/log/forge.log`)... ok, now that JBoss is downloaded into your local Maven directory... there it is.... just type `as`, press `TAB` and you will see new commands : 

[source, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ as-
as-deploy  as-setup  as-shutdown  as-start  as-undeploy
----

So let's build the application, start JBoss with `as-start` and deploy our application with `as-deploy` :

[source, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ build
[cdbookstore]$ as-start
(...)
JBoss logs
(...)
[cdbookstore]$ as-deploy
----

WildFly is started, the application is deployed, you can now go to http://localhost:8080/cdbookstore and create new books and authors. 

==== Installing the JBoss AS Forge addon on JBDS

Open the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) and choose _Install an Addon from GIT_, enter
_https://github.com/jerr/as-addon_ as GIT Repository URL ad _org.jboss.forge.addon:as,2.0.0-SNAPSHOT_ as Coordinate:

[source]
--
GIT Repository: https://github.com/jerr/as-addon | Coordinate: org.jboss.forge.addon:as,2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
--

image::../images/using/addon-install.png[title="Installing an Addon"]

Now perform the same action for:
[source]
--
GIT Repository: https://github.com/jerr/jboss-as-addon | Coordinate: org.jboss.forge.addon:jboss-as-wf8,2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
--

It's now time to set up your server. Open the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) and choose
_AS: Setup_, then select _wildfly8_:

image::../images/using/as-setup.png[title="AS Setup"]

Click next to configure the _Install directory_, _Port_ and so on:

image::../images/using/as-configuration.png[title="Configuration AS"]

Now let's build the application:

Open the Forge wizard (Ctrl + 4 or CMD + 4 on Mac) and choose _Build_:

image::../images/using/build.png[title="Building"]

Now start server with the _AS: Start_ command and deploy application with _AS: Deploy_:

image::../images/using/as-deploy.png[title="Deployinig"]

Click Finish, and your application will be deployed on WildFly.


=== Creating Arquillian tests

http://arquillian.org/[Arquillian] is an innovative and highly extensible testing platform for the JVM that enables developers to easily create automated integration, functional and acceptance tests for Java middleware. Picking up where unit tests leave off, Arquillian handles all the plumbing of container management, deployment and framework initialization so you can focus on the task at hand, writing your tests. Real tests. In shortâ€¦

Arquillian brings the test to the runtime so you donâ€™t have to manage the runtime from the test (or the build). Arquillian eliminates this burden by covering all aspects of test execution, which entails:

- Managing the lifecycle of the container (or containers)
- Bundling the test case, dependent classes and resources into a ShrinkWrap archive (or archives)
- Deploying the archive (or archives) to the container (or containers)
- Enriching the test case by providing dependency injection and other declarative services
- Executing the tests inside (or against) the container
- Capturing the results and returning them to the test runner for reporting

To avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into the developerâ€™s build environment, Arquillian integrates seamlessly with familiar testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit 4, TestNG 5), allowing tests to be launched using existing IDE, Ant and Maven test plugins â€” without any add-ons.

==== Installing the Arquillian Forge addon

Like the WildFly add-on we just installed and used, bringing Arquillian capabilities to Forge is just a matter of installing one add-on. The easiest installation method is to install directly from a Git repository by executing the following command in the Forge console:

[source, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ addon-install-from-git --url https://github.com/forge/addon-arquillian.git --coordinate org.arquillian.forge:arquillian-addon
----

To make sure the add-on is properly installed, enter `arq` and press `TAB`, you should see the command `arquillian-setup`. Now, let's use it.

NOTE: Don't forget to have a look at the available add-ons on http://forge.jboss.org/addons

==== CLI

The first thing to do is to setup Arquillian for WildFly by execute the following command: 

[source, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ arquillian-setup --arquillianVersion 1.1.5.Final --testFramework junit --testFrameworkVersion 4.11 --containerAdapter wildfly-remote --containerAdapterVersion 8.1.0.Final
----

This command adds all the needed dependencies in our `pom.xml` (JUnit, Arquillian core, Arquillian extension for WildFly) and Maven Profile (`arquillian-wildfly-remote`) to run the Arquillian tests. This command has also created an `arquillian.xml` file where all the Arquillian configuration goes. As you can see, with a single command, JBoss Forge has dealt with all the plumbing configuration. 

To create an Arquillian tests, it is as easy: we use the `arquillian-create-test` command and target a specific bean. For example, in our example we can create a test for the `BookBean` as follow: 

[source, console]
----
[cdbookstore]$ arquillian-create-test --targets org.cdbookstore.view.BookBean
----

This creates the `BookBeanTest` under `src/test/java`. The way to run this test is first, make sure WildFly is up and running, second, use the right Maven profile: 

[source, console]
----
mvn install -Parquillian-wildfly-remote
----

The test might not work and you should look at the stack trace on the server side. If you get any `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException` (example `org.cdbookstore.model.Book`) that's because you need to fix the http://arquillian.org/guides/shrinkwrap_introduction/[Shrinkwrap] packaging by adding the missing class. And if the persistent unit is unknown, you need to package it explicitly under the `META-INF` directory. For example, in the code below, Shrinkwrap wraps the `BookBean` and `Book` class into 

[source, java]
----
   @Deployment
   public static JavaArchive createDeployment()
   {
      return ShrinkWrap.create(JavaArchive.class)
            .addClass(Book.class)
            .addClass(BookBean.class)
            .addAsManifestResource("META-INF/persistence.xml", "persistence.xml")
            .addAsManifestResource(EmptyAsset.INSTANCE, "beans.xml");
   }
----

The test should be green. Isn't it? 

Again, with a few Forge commands you manage to setup Arquillian, generate a test and execute it. You have no more excuse for not testing. 

=== Keep on playing

Here we just show you a subset of the JBoss Forge features, but don't hesitate to keep on playing with other commands (full list in appendix). Now that you feel confortable with Forge, let's jump to the next section.
